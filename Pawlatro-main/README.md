# PAWLATRO

A furry mod for the hit game-of-the-year-nominee Balatro! Currently adds 7 different jokers and a new poker hand to the game themed around fandom references and jokes. Many more additions are planned on future versions!

## How To Install

This mod requires Steammodded to work. If you don't know what that is, I recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY2LnRYWm5Y) YouTube tutorial, which explains how to download steammoded and any Balatro mod you may wish to (hopefully this one is one of them).
