# __**Demo 3 Patch Notes**__

## [New Consumable Type - Zodiacs](https://imgur.com/fn4c417)
The second consumable type of Ortalab, **Zodiacs**, is full released in this demo. Zodiacs enhance future plays of specific hand types, adding temporary levels to them and having a secondary effect that manipulates your deck. Each Zodiac starts by providing **+4** temporary levels, which reduces by 2 each activation - each Zodiac triggers twice by default. Using a Zodiac a second time will add the temporary levels to the existing Zodiac, allowing you to stack up high amounts of temporary levels.
Zodiacs also come with a package of supporting jokers, as well as **two voucher pairs** and **X patches**.

*Full colour art Zodiacs are available as a Malverk texture pack*
