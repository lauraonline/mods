This is a version of the mod designed to be patched directly to the base game EXE so that no mod loader is required.
Be aware that if the game gets updated, these changes will be lost, so you will need to repeat this process.

Step 1: Navigate to the game folder.
On Steam, you can get there by right clicking Balatro in your library and going to "Manage > Browse local files."

Step 2: Copy Balatro.exe as a backup before making any changes.

Step 3: Open Balatro.exe as an archive.
You can do this using 7-Zip: Open 7-Zip, browse to the Balatro folder, then right click on Balatro.exe and choose "Open inside."
(Alternatively, if you temporarily change the file extension to .7z, you may be able to browse it in the file explorer.
If you do this, be sure to change the extension back to .exe after making changes.)

Step 4: Extract main.lua from the base directory inside Balatro.exe.
Open it with a text editor and append the contents of KeyboardControlsPatch.lua to the end of it.
Be sure to configure keys and other settings at the top of this section.
Once done, replace the main.lua in Balatro.exe with your new version.

Step 5: Unless you've disabled the changeButtonIconsToKeys setting, drag in the included "resources" folder to merge with the one inside Balatro.exe.
This should put keyboard_icons.png (at both 1x and 2x scale) in the proper places.
