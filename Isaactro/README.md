# Isaactro
Mod for Balatro that adds 50 The Binding of Isaac items as jokers (65 including all Birthright effects)

## Installation
Follow the installation guide for [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded) found here: [Guide](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki)

Then, simply download and unzip in the Mods folder

## Acknowledgements
Assets were scraped from the Isaac Wiki (as seen in [create_joker_art.ipynb](https://github.com/WilliamFlinchbaugh/Isaactro/blob/main/create_joker_art.ipynb)), which I'm pretty sure were taken directly from the game. I just pasted the item images onto templates I created for each item quality.

I took a lot of inspiration and implementation help from the ExtraCredit mod found here: [ExtraCredit](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit)

I didn't find this until just after I released this, but HYPERPUP seems to have made a pretty cool Isaac-themed mod that is a lot more comprehensive, find it here: [The Binding of Jimbo](https://jimbo.hyperpup.pet/)

## Notes
For the art, I really wanted to have unique art for each, but I'm just not an artist and don't have money to spend to commission it. If someone is willing to do some art, I'd be super happy to update with new assets. I may still create assets myself in the future if I find the time.

If anyone finds bugs, thinks something needs balancing, or wants to contribute, feel free to create an issue and we can discuss it!

## Future Goals
I want to possibly reskin the boss blinds to be Isaac bosses. 

I'd also like to implement the reverse tarot cards like in Isaac, but I'm worried that would really throw off the balance of the tarot card pool
