# Mystes' Open Jokers - A Balatro Mod

## Introduction

This Balatro mod offers 15 new jokers (some are fusion jokers and require the [Fusion Jokers](https://itayfeder.github.io/Fusion-Jokers/) mod to operate) and other very minor adjustments to the game.

It contains "open" in the name because the jokers are free to take and use in other mods - I do not plan to maintain this mod for long, so if you see something you like, feel free to steal it for yourself and your mod!

Requires Steamodded 0.9.8
