# Quickly forfeit your Balatro runs with the 'Fold' button!

![Balatro Fold Button Demo Gif](https://github.com/happinyz/BalatroFoldButton/assets/59787978/c1108119-b29e-454d-9c52-ee5195b807ef)

Currently, Balatro does not have a way to easily concede a run. There is a "New Run" button, which allows the player to quickly leave an ongoing run and start a new run. However, this will not bring up the postgame stats screen, which many players enjoy and find very informative. This simple mod introduces a theme-appropriate "Fold" button. Pressing this button during a run will forfeit the run and bring up the postgame stats.

# Upcoming Improvements
- Confirmation window after pressing the Fold button.
- Make the "Defeated By" section in the postgame stats screen reflect that the player had folded.
