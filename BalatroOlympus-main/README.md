# BalatroOlympus
Mod for the game Balatro adding Greek mythology based Jokers, made using Steamodded.

Current Progress (6/?)

Every Joker is planned to have a synergy with every other Joker.

I am not an artist, so the art is very rudimentary. Get in touch if you want to improve it.

# Jokers:

Artemis (Rare): adds a "The Moon" Tarot card when Blind is selected.

Apollo (Rare): adds a "The Sun" Tarot card when Blind is selected.

Hephaestus (Rare): all cards become Steel cards when scored.

Hades (Uncommon):  if first hand of round has only 1 card, destroy it and earn $3.

Hera (Uncommon): every played Queen gives +13 Mult when scored.

Zeus (uncommon): every played King gives +13 Mult when scored.

~work in progress below~

Hermes: gain [] money for each previous Blind skipped when Blind is selected

Athena: 

Aphrodite:

Poseidon:

Dionysus:

Demeter:

# Synergies (bonus is applied to the first listed Joker):

The Twins (Artemis + Apollo): if both Artemis and Apollo Jokers are owned, x5 Mult if played hand has a scoring Club card and a scoring Heart card. 

Royal Matrimony (Zeus + Hera): if both Zeus and Hera Jokers are owned, x3 Mult if played hand has a scoring King card and a scoring Queen card
